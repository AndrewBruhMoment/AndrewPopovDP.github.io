            The 2020 Flex Time Project is an assignemnt in which students use a small portion of their class time to design a project that they are interested in.
            Projects can range from stop-motion movies to video games. These projects incourage the students to inovate and try something new.

            <b>What type of project did you make? Explain why.</b><br><br>
            I made a website. I decided to make a website because I was interested in trying HTML and CSS<br><br>
            <b>What did you find most challenging about making this project?</b><br><br>
            I found research the most challenging part.<br><br>
            <b>What did you enjoy the most about making this project?</b><br><br>
            I enjoyed HTML the most in this project.<br><br>
            <b>What did you like most about your final project?</b><br><br>
            I liked the visuals; how the project looked is what I liked.<br><br>
            <b>What would you change about your final project?</b><br><br>
            I would have added more pages from my original portfolio.<br><br>
