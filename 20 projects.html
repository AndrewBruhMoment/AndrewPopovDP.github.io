        <p class="text">
            20% Projects are a way to enjoy technology.
            Based of off google's 20% Time, students are allowed to work on their
            own projects for 20% of
            their class
            time as a way for them to explore creative ways to use technology.
            You will find my 20% Time projects here.

        <p class="leftfloat" style="font-weight:500;">
            In this 20% Time Project I explored Unity and it's variety of tools and features for the building of
            games. Unity has many tools and features that are designed not only for games, but also for 3D design,
            and even has the capability to be used as a simulation software.
